## Framing (10 min / 10 min)

This lesson is going to be almost entirely you working through some exercises we have prepared for you.

These exercises may use CSS properties with which you're unfamiliar. In fact, you may not be familiar with CSS at all.

Q. What should you do if something is unfamiliar?
---
> 1. Read it like English. CSS is intended to be readable, although sometimes it's more successful than at other times.
> 2. Look it up. If you don't know what `box-sizing` means, Google `css box-sizing`.

The purpose of this class isn't for you to walk away being an expert in all things CSS. That takes months. Rather, it's for you to be exposed to all the things that can be accomplished with CSS. If they're on your radar, you can always look them up later.

Remember: being a good web designer is like being a good artist. We can teach you to hold the paintbrush, but it's on you to create a masterpiece!

Q. What is Bootstrap, and how do you feel about it?
---
> Bootstrap is a CSS *library*: it's a stylesheet you can link to in your HTML, and it provides you with a bunch of classes that you can apply that make things look really nice.
> Many designers sniff at Bootstrap because, they argue, sites that use it all look the same. However, unless you plan on specializing in front-end design, a Bootstrapped site may be better than a site with no CSS, or a site with handmade CSS: it shows that you recognize what your strengths are and are focused on delivering a product, rather than doing things the "right" way. 

## Quiz Questions

- What is the purpose of `flex-box`?
- What does `*` select?
- What does `box-sizing:border-box` do?
- What's the difference between `position:relative`, `position:absolute`, and `position:fixed`?
- How would you apply styles only for screens narrower than 480 pixels?
